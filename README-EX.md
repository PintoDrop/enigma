## Description

For this application I was tasked with creating a thorough readme generator. For this task I made sure all the information entered by the user was able to show up in a new md file. This will help a developer quickly and easily complete a thorough read me.

## Installation

You will need to use the npm i after cloning the repo for this project.

## Usage

This will help the user create a fully developed read me that will save them time with formatting. The user will be able to enter the information needed that will be inputted into the readme.md file for them.
