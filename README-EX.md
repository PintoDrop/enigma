## Description

For this application I was tasked with creating a thorough readme generator. For this task I made sure all the information entered by the user was able to show up in a new md file. This will help a developer quickly and easily complete a thorough read me. 

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

This application allows the user to create a fully developed readme quickly by going through a series of questions about the project. Once these questions are complete then all the entered information will be added to the readme.
