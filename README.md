# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


# Read Me Generator

## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a README generator to make it faster for the developer to create a well thought out read me they can use on their applications.

## Usage

The user will be able to use this application to enter in some information about their application. After they have entered this information they will be presented with a read me that they can use in their project. This will help both the developer and the user to better understand the application. 

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

## Criteria for assignment

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

**WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository**

**WHEN I enter my project title**
*THEN this is displayed as the title of the README*

**WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions**
*THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests*

**WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options**
*THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under*

**WHEN I enter my GitHub username**
*THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile*

**WHEN I enter my email address**
*THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions*
