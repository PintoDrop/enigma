# Read Me Generator

## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a README generator to make it faster for the developer to create a well thought out read me they can use on their applications.

## Usage

The user will be able to use this application to enter in some information about their application. After they have entered this information they will be presented with a read me that they can use in their project. This will help both the developer and the user to better understand the application.

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

## Criteria for assignment

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

**WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository**
_THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions_

**WHEN I enter my project title**
_THEN this is displayed as the title of the README_

**WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions**
_THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests_

**WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options**
_THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under_

**WHEN I enter my GitHub username**
_THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile_

**WHEN I enter my email address**
_THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions_

**WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents**
_THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README_
